## Install Kubeflow on DigitalOcean Kubernetes 

> This repo is part of the [DigitalOcean Kubernetes Challenge](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/pages/kubernetes-challenge#anchor--success-criteria)

I have been wanting to play with Kubeflow out of curiosity and for fun more than anything. Installing it locally sounds like it could torture my machine. Even if it ended up working doing any kind of machine learning could take up a lot out of my processors. Instead, taking advantage of DigitalOcean Kubernetes is a good choice when you can pay $10/month to get started with real Kubernetes. Since it's Kubernetes, once you pick a cluster it's easy to add or remove nodes pools to manage performance and costs. You can get started right away and don't need to manyally configure and maintain your Kubernetes cluster. Workloads aren’t dependent on your internet connection and machine/lab setup if you need more power its easy to add with DOKS

Why install Kubeflow?

Kubeflow is a very fascinating project that originally started as a simple way to run Tensorflow on Kubernetes, but has since expanded. Now, Kubeflow has many common tools and frameworks used for Machine Learning to make it possible to run end-to-end ML workflows on Kubernetes. The Kubeflow project has a lot of the major machine learning and data science tools out there. Using it is also fun because it's so customizable and easy to get Jupyter notebook or terminal running.


### Upside to installing Kubeflow manually
* You can choose as much or as little of the Kubeflow components you want to include
* Kubeflow installation can be more robust than even the "official" cloud versions of Kubeflow
